as early as 1905  In its early years the organization moved to and from various locations throughout Manhattan  AT that time it was basically a gentlemens club of members who were interested in all types of model building  In 1926 the Society was formalized and incorporated under the laws of the State of New York  This was done so that the Society could obtain a permit to use a lake in New York Citys Central Park for model motor boat races  It was also at this time that the Society began construction of its first Model Railroad  The Union Connecting  Over the next twenty years the Society moved from its original location to two other locations  Each move doubling the size of the previous location and of course doubling the size of the model train layout  During WW2 many Society members were called to service in the Armed Forces  Regrettably the largest of the layouts had to be dismantled  The location of the layout in the basement of the Astor Building was requested for the war effort  The dismantling was done with care with salvaged usable materials going into scrap drives for the War effort  As members returned after the War a new location was searched for  This led to an

is the systematic alteration of mortgage loan agreements that help those having problems making the payments by reducing interest rates monthly payments or principal balances  Lending institutions could make one or more of these changes to relieve financial pressure on borrowers to prevent the condition of foreclosure  Loan modifications have been practiced in the United States since The 2008 Crash Of The Housing Market from Washington Mutual Chase Home Finance Chase JP Morgan  Chase other contributors like MERs  Crimes of Mortgage ad Real Estate Staff had long assisted nd finally the squeaky will could not continue as their deviant practices broke the state and crashed  Modification owners either ordered by The United States Department of Housing The United States IRS or President Obamas letters from Note Holders came to those various departments asking for the Democratic process to help them keep their homes and protection them from explosion  Thus the birth of Modifications  It is yet to date for clarity how theses enforcements came into existence and except b whom but t is certain that note holders form the Midwest reached out in the Democratic Process for assistance  FBI Mortgage Fraud Department came into existence  Modifications HMAP HARP were also birthed to help note holders get Justice through reduced mortgage by making terms legal  Modification of mortgage terms was introduced by IRS staff addressing the crisis called the HAMP TEAMS that went across the United States desiring the new products to assist homeowners that were victims of predatory lending practices unethical staff brokers attorneys and lenders that contributed to the crash  Modification were a fix to the crash as litigation has ensued as the lenders reorganized and renamed the lending institutions and government agencies are to closely monitor them  Prior to modifications loan holders that experiences crisis would use Loan assumptions and Loan transfers to keep the note in the 1930s  During the Great Depression loan transfers loan assumption and loan bail out programs took place at the state level in an effort to reduce levels of loan foreclosures while the Federal Bureau of Investigation Federal Trade Commission Comptroller the United States Government and State Government responded to lending institution violations of law in these arenas by setting public court records that are legal precedence of such illegal actions  The legal precedents and reporting agencies were created to address the violations of laws to consumers while the Modifications were created to assist the consumers that are victims of predatory lending practices  During the so-called Great Recession of the early 21st century loan modification became a matter of national policy with various actions taken to alter mortgage loan terms to prevent further economic destabilization  Due to absorbent personal profits nothing has been done to educate Homeowners or Creditors that this money from equity escrow is truly theirs the Loan Note Holder and it is their monetary rights as the real prize and reason for the Housing Crash was the profit n obtaining the mortgage holders Escrow  The Escrow and Equity that is accursed form the Note Holders payments various staff through the United States claimed as recorded and cashed by all staff in real-estate from local residential Tax Assessing Staff Real Estate Staff Ordinance Staff Police Staff Brokers attorneys lending institutional staff but typically Attorneys who are also typically the owners or Rental properties that are trained through Bankruptcies  that collect the Escrow that is rightfully the Homeowners but because most Homeowners are unaware of what money is due them and how they can loose their escrow  Most Creditors are unaware that as the note holder that the Note Holder are due a annual or semi annual equity check and again bank or other lending and or legal intuitions staff claim this monies instead  This money Note Holders were unaware of is the prize of real estate and the cause of the Real Estate Crash of 2008 where Lending Institutions provided mortgages to people years prior they know they would eventually loose with Loan holders purchasing Balloon Mortgages lending product that is designed to make fast money off the note holder whom is always typically unaware of their escrow equity and that are further victimized by conferences and books on HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN REAL STATE - when in fact the money is the Note Holder  The key of the crash was not the House but the loan product used and the interest and money that was accrued form the note holders that staff too immorally  The immoral and illegal actions of predatory lending station and their staff began with the inception of balloon mortgages although illegal activity has always existed in the arena yet the crash created Watch Dog like HAMP TEAM IRS COMPTROLLER Federal Trade Commission Consumer Protection Bureau FBI CIA Local Police Department ICE  The FBI online Computer crime division receives and investigates computer crimes that record keeping staff from title companies lending institutional staff legal staff and others created fraudulent documents to change payments and billing of note holders to obtain the money note holders are typically unaware of and other watch dog agencies came into existence to examine if houses were purchased through a processed check at Government Debited office as many obtained free homes illegally  Many were incarcerated for such illegal actions  Modifications fixed the Notes to proper lower interest escrow tax fees that staff typically raised for no reason  Many people from various arenas involved in reals estate have been incarcerated for these actions as well as other illegal actions like charging for a modification  Additionally Modifications were also made to address the falsifications such as inappropriate mortgage charges filing of fraudulently deeds reporting of and at times filing of fraudulent mortgages that were already paid off that were fraudulently continued by lenders staff and attorneys or brokers or anyone in the Real Estate Chain through the issues of real estate terms to continue to violate United States Laws contract law and legal precedence where collusion was often done again to defraud and steal from the Note Holder was such a common practice that was evidence as to why the Mortgage Crash in 2008 occurred for the purpose of wining the prize of stealing form Homeowners and those that foreclosed was actually often purposefully for these monies note holders were unaware of to be obtained which was why Balloon mortgages and loans were given to the staff in the Real Estate Market with the hoper and the expectation that the loan holders would default as it offered opportunity to commit illegal transactions of obtaining the homeowners funds  While such scams were addressed through modifications in 2008  The

types of model building  In 1926 the Society was formalized and incorporated under the laws of the State of New York  This was done so that the Society could obtain a permit to use a lake in New York Citys Central Park for model motor boat races  It was also at this time that the Society began construction of its first Model Railroad  The Union Connecting  Over the next twenty years the Society moved from its original location to two other locations  Each move doubling the size of the previous location and of course doubling the size of the model train layout  During WW2 many Society members were called to service in the Armed Forces  Regrettably the largest of the layouts had to be dismantled  The location of the layout in the basement of the Astor Building was requested for the war effort  The dismantling was done with care with salvaged usable materials going into scrap drives for the War effort  As members returned after the War a new location was searched for  This led to an

Bank Colisée  They were the second QMJHL team in the United States and the only one to play a full season  They won the Presidents Cup in 2007 Loan modification in the United States Loan modification is the systematic alteration of mortgage loan agreements that help those having problems making the payments by reducing interest rates monthly payments or principal balances  Lending institutions could make one or more of these changes to relieve financial pressure on borrowers to prevent the condition of foreclosure  Loan modifications have been practiced in the United States since The 2008 Crash Of The Housing Market from Washington Mutual Chase Home Finance Chase JP Morgan  Chase other contributors like MERs  Crimes of Mortgage ad Real Estate Staff had long assisted nd finally the squeaky will could not continue as their deviant practices broke the state and crashed  Modification owners either ordered by The United States Department of Housing The United States IRS or President Obamas letters from Note Holders came to those various departments asking for the Democratic process to help them keep their homes and protection them from explosion  Thus the birth of Modifications  It is yet to date for clarity how theses enforcements came into existence and except b whom but t is certain that note holders form the Midwest reached out in the Democratic Process for assistance  FBI Mortgage Fraud Department came into existence  Modifications HMAP HARP were also birthed to help note holders get Justice through reduced mortgage by making terms legal  Modification of mortgage terms was introduced by IRS staff addressing the crisis called the HAMP TEAMS that went across the United States desiring the new products to assist homeowners that were victims of predatory lending practices unethical staff brokers attorneys and lenders that contributed to the crash  Modification were a fix to the crash as litigation has ensued as the lenders reorganized and renamed the lending institutions and government agencies are to closely monitor them  Prior to modifications loan holders that experiences crisis would use Loan assumptions and Loan transfers to keep the note in the 1930s  During the Great Depression loan transfers loan assumption and loan bail out programs took place at the state level in an effort to reduce levels of loan foreclosures while the Federal Bureau of Investigation Federal Trade Commission Comptroller the United States Government and State Government responded to lending institution violations of law in these arenas by setting public court records that are legal precedence of such illegal actions  The legal precedents and reporting agencies were created to address the violations of laws to consumers while the Modifications were created to assist the consumers that are victims of predatory lending practices  During the so-called Great Recession of the early 21st century loan modification became a matter of national policy with various actions taken to alter mortgage loan terms to prevent further economic destabilization  Due to absorbent personal profits nothing has been done to educate Homeowners or Creditors that this money from equity escrow is truly theirs the Loan Note Holder and it is their monetary rights as the real prize and reason for the Housing Crash was the profit n obtaining the mortgage holders Escrow  The Escrow and Equity that is accursed form the Note Holders payments various staff through the United States claimed as recorded and cashed by all staff in real-estate from local residential Tax Assessing Staff Real Estate Staff Ordinance Staff Police Staff Brokers attorneys lending institutional staff but typically Attorneys who are also typically the owners or Rental properties that are trained through Bankruptcies  that collect the Escrow that is rightfully the Homeowners but because most Homeowners are unaware of what money is due them and how they can loose their escrow  Most Creditors are unaware that as the note holder that the Note Holder are due a annual or semi annual equity check and again bank or other lending and or legal intuitions staff claim this monies instead  This money Note Holders were unaware of is the prize of real estate and the cause of the Real Estate Crash of 2008 where Lending Institutions provided mortgages to people years prior they know they would eventually loose with Loan holders purchasing Balloon Mortgages lending product that is designed to make fast money off the note holder whom is always typically unaware of their escrow equity and that are further victimized by conferences and books on HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN REAL STATE - when in fact the money is the Note Holder  The key of the crash was not the House but the loan product used and the interest and money that was accrued form the note holders that staff too immorally  The immoral and illegal actions of predatory lending station and their staff began with the inception of balloon mortgages although illegal activity has always existed in the arena yet the crash created Watch Dog like HAMP TEAM IRS COMPTROLLER Federal Trade Commission Consumer Protection Bureau FBI CIA Local Police Department ICE  The FBI online Computer crime division receives and investigates computer crimes that record keeping staff from title companies lending institutional staff legal staff and others created fraudulent documents to change payments and billing of note holders to obtain the money note holders are typically unaware of and other watch dog agencies came into existence to examine if houses were purchased through a processed check at Government Debited office as many obtained free homes illegally  Many were incarcerated for such illegal actions  Modifications fixed the Notes to proper lower interest escrow tax fees that staff typically raised for no reason  Many people from various arenas involved in reals estate have been incarcerated for these actions as well as other illegal actions like charging for a modification  Additionally Modifications were also made to address the falsifications such as inappropriate mortgage charges filing of fraudulently deeds reporting of and at times filing of fraudulent mortgages that were already paid off that were fraudulently continued by lenders staff and attorneys or brokers or anyone in the Real Estate Chain through the issues of real estate terms to continue to violate United States Laws contract law and legal precedence where collusion was often done again to defraud and steal from the Note Holder was such a common practice that was evidence as to why the Mortgage Crash in 2008 occurred for the purpose of wining the prize of stealing form Homeowners and those that foreclosed was actually often purposefully for these monies note holders were unaware of to be obtained which was why Balloon mortgages and loans were given to the staff in the Real Estate Market with the hoper and the expectation that the loan holders would default as it offered opportunity to commit illegal transactions of obtaining the homeowners funds  While such scams were addressed through modifications in 2008  The Market relied heavily on Consumers ignorance to prosper ignorance of real estate terms ignorance on what they were to be charged properly for unethical financial gain and while staff in real estates lending arenas mingled terms to deceive y deliberate confusion consumers out of cash and homes while the USA Government provided Justice through President Obamas Inception and IRS Inception of Modifications which addressed these unethical profits in Reals Estate  It was in 2009 that HARP HAMP and Modifications were introduced to stop the victimization of Note Holders  Taking on the Banks that ran USA Government was a great and dangerous undertaking that made America Great Again as Justice for Consumers reigned  Legal action taken against institutions that have such business practices can be viewed in State Code of Law and Federal Law on precedent cases that are available to the public  Finally It had been unlawful to be charged by an attorney to modify as well as fro banking staff to modify terms to increase a mortgage and or change lending product to a balloon in an concerted effort to make homeowner foreclose which is also illegal computer fraud and not the governments intended purpose or definition of a modification 2007 Memorial Cup The 2007 MasterCard Memorial Cup was played in May 2007 in Vancouver British Columbia at the Pacific Coliseum  It was the 89th annual

the Lyric Hall which opened in 1875  It showed the first movies around 1900  The Family and the Cozy theaters opened around the turn of the century  The Lyric was condemned and torn down in 1913 and the other two were considered substandard  The Cresco Commercial Club held a fundraiser in early 1914 to build an opera house  The Cresco Opera House Company was organized around the same time  The building was completed by the end of the year and it opened in 1915  It was designed by local engineer Joseph H Howe and constructed by local builder Martin Johnson  The musical High Jinks was the first performance held in the theater  The theater which seats 425 was equipped to show movies and there was a community hall in the basement  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places

organisms GMOs  The ordinance entitled Measure H was passed by referendum on March 2 2004  Initiated by the group GMO Free Mendocino the campaign was a highly publicized grassroots effort by local farmers and environmental groups who contend that the potential risks of GMOs to human health and the ecosystem have not yet been fully understood  The measure was met with opposition by several interest groups representing the biotechnology industry The California Plant Health Association now the Western Plant Health Association and CropLife America a Washington-based consortium whose clients represent some of the largest food distributors in the nation including Monsanto DuPont and Dow Chemical  Since the enactment of the ordinance Mendocino County has been added to an international list of GMO free zones  Pre-emptive statutes banning local municipalities from such ordinances have now become widespread with adoption in sixteen states Wilford H Fawcett House The

attorney who had been appointed to several local government positions  Though Percy had been expected to coast to re-election over Seith a first-time candidate the election quickly became competitive  In the last few days of the campaign a desperate Percy ran a television advertisement that featured him apologizing and acknowledging that I got your message and youre right  Percys last-ditch effort
